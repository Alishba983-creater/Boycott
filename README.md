Project Title: Bycott ‚Äì A Java-based GUI Application for Ethical Consumer Choices
Description:

Bycott is a Java-based graphical user interface (GUI) application designed to empower consumers to make ethical shopping decisions by identifying and boycotting Israeli products. Built with Java Swing, the application offers a clean, user-friendly interface and a strong social message, aligning technology with activism.

Core Features:

üîç Product Identification: Users can search for a product to check whether it is linked to Israeli companies or brands.

üö´ Boycott Alerts: If a product is associated with Israel, the app notifies the user that the item is not recommended, emphasizing ethical concerns.

‚úÖ Suggests Alternatives: Instead of leaving the user without options, Bycott suggests verified, ethical alternative products from non-Israeli or Palestinian-friendly sources.

üìö Educational Section: A dedicated section shares the history of Palestine, the importance of boycotting, and how it contributes to the larger movement.

üíñ Donation Links: Users can access trusted donation platforms to support Palestinian relief efforts directly.

‚ûï Add to List: Users can also contribute by adding new products they believe should be boycotted to a community-managed list.

Why Bycott?

The name Bycott is a creative twist on the word "boycott," representing a conscious "Buy + Boycott" movement. It symbolizes not just avoiding unethical products but actively supporting better alternatives. The app blends tech with purpose, offering a peaceful digital resistance to injustice.
